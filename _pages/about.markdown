*The Wave Equation Simulated by Spectral Methods.*

I am an applied math first year student at [University Illinois at Chicago](https://mscs.uic.edu). I did my undergrad in [math](https://math.ufl.edu) and [physics](https://www.phys.ufl.edu) at University Of Florida. I am currently interested in mathematics of elastic materials and convergence of variational problems.
