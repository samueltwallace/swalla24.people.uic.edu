I am an applied math first year student at [University Illinois at Chicago](mscs.uic.edu). I did my undergrad in math and physics at [University of Florida](math.ufl.edu). I like mechanics of all sorts (classical, statistical, quantum) and like working on problems related to physics or engineering.

You can email me at the email on the main page. I also have a [GitHub](github.com/samueltwallace).
