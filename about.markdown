I am an applied math first year student at [University Illinois at Chicago](mscs.uic.edu). I did my undergrad in math and physics at [University](math.ufl.edu) Of [Florida](phys.ufl.edu). I like mechanics of all sorts (classical, statistical, quantum) and like working on problems related to physics or engineering.

You can email me at the email on the main page. I also have a [GitHub](github.com/samueltwallace).

This site is made with [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). You can see the source code in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/samueltwallace/swalla24.people.uic.edu).
