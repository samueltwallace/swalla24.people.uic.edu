I am an applied math first year student at [University Illinois at Chicago](https://mscs.uic.edu). I did my undergrad in math and physics at [University](https://math.ufl.edu) Of [Florida](https://www.phys.ufl.edu). I like mechanics of all sorts (classical, statistical, quantum) and like working on problems related to physics or engineering, often involving differential equations. I also like doing some coding, so I like implementing code that helps gives answers to these problems.

You can email me at the email on the main page. I also have a [GitHub](github.com/samueltwallace).

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You can see the source code in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/samueltwallace/swalla24.people.uic.edu).
